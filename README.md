<h2>Hi there, welcome to my Profile  🚀 </h2> 

<div align="start">
  
<p>My name is Melina and I just recently started a FRONT-END course at the coding school <a href="https://molengeek.com/">MolenGeek</a> in Brussels, Belgium.</p>

<h2>ABOUT ME</h2> 

<p>Unfulfilled in my previous job, I decided in 2023 to completely reorient myself towards web development. A field that had always interested me, but was completely new to me.</p>

<p>Molengeek allowed me to discover qualities that I had not known existed until then.</p>
