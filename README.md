<h2>A BIT MORE ABOUT ME</h2> 

<p>Unfulfilled in my previous job, I decided in 2023 to completely reorient myself towards web development. A field that had always interested me, but was completely new to me.</p>

<p>Molengeek allowed me to discover qualities that I had not known existed until then.</p>
